# Overview of Data

This seminar will use a dataset downloaded from Kaggle that contains real and fake news: (https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).]

_Note_: As of a few days ago, this data set has disappeared from Kaggle. This seminar was designed and began being built before the data set disappeared.
