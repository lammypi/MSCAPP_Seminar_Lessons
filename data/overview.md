# Overview of Data

This seminar will use a dataset downloaded from Kaggle that contains real and fake news: [https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

_Note_: As of Jan 2024, the data set was removed from Kaggle. It can be found [here](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/2022/11/27/fake-news-detection-datasets/).
